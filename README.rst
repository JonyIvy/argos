Install
=======

Install using Flatpak
---------------------

Argos can be easily installed on Linux distributions supporting
`Flatpak <https://flatpak.org/>`_::

  $ flatpak install flathub io.github.orontee.Argos
  $ flatpak run io.github.orontee.Argos

Visit `Argos page on Flathub
<https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.orontee.Argos>`_ for
detailed instructions.

Install using DEB package
-------------------------

``Argos`` was developed to be deployed on a Raspberry Pi Model 2B
(hosting a Mopidy server) running Raspian OS with `LXDE desktop
environment <http://www.lxde.org/>`_. It's a 32-bits beast based on
armv7 and unfortunately there's no chance to have Flatpak support this
architecture according to this ``freedesktop-sdk`` issue:
`Decommissioning armv7
<https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk/-/issues/1105>`_.

Installation on such platform is handled through a DEB package that
can be downloaded from the `Releases page
<https://github.com/orontee/argos/releases>`_::

  $ VERSION=1.5.0
  $ wget https://github.com/orontee/argos/releases/download/v${VERSION}/argos_${VERSION}-1_all.deb
  $ sudo dpkg -i argos_${VERSION}-1_all.deb

Configuration
=============

One must set the URL of the Mopidy server using the preferences
dialog. The default value is ``http://127.0.0.1:6680``, meaning Mopidy
server is expected to be listening on the local host using HTTP and
the default 6680 port.

The preferences dialog is accessible from the application menu.

   Preferences dialog

The URL of the Mopidy server is backed by GSettings. Thus in case the
host has no keyboard, one can directly set the URL of the Mopidy
server through an SSH connection. Make sure changes are done by the
user that will run Argos. Changes can be made using `Dconf Editor
<https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DconfEditor>`_ or the command line::

  $ gsettings set io.github.orontee.Argos mopidy-base-url http://192.168.1.45

Some CLI options are provided (complete list can be obtained with
``argos --help``)::

  $ argos --no-tooltips --hide-search-button

Style
-----

The application is based on `GTK <https://www.gtk.org/>`_ library
which uses CSS for styling and layout.

To adapt to devices with small touch screen one may have to tweak
buttons appearance. Here is an example used to widen some buttons
(to be placed in ``~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css``)::

  #playlist-button-box buttonbox button,
  #album-details-button-box button,
  #condensed-playing-box-playback-controls-box button {
      min-width: 60px;
      min-height: 30px;
  }
