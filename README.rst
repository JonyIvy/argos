Install
=======

Platform supporting Flatpak
---------------------------

Clone the source repository, then build and install for current user
(You may have to install the expected runtime, but Flatpak will warn
you about that)::

  $ flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean builddir app.argos.Argos.json

Then to start the application use your desktop environment launcher,
or from a shell run::

  $ flatpak run app.argos.Argos

Other platform
--------------

``Argos`` was developed to be deployed on a Raspberry Pi Model 2B
(hosting a Mopidy server) running Raspian OS with `LXDE desktop
environment <http://www.lxde.org/>`_. It's a 32-bits beast based on
armv7 and unfortunately there's no chance to have Flatpak support this
architecture according to this ``freedesktop-sdk`` issue:
`Decommissioning armv7
<https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk/-/issues/1105>`_.

Installation on such platform is currently handled by hand! A
dedicated target to the ``meson`` build configuration will soon be
provided.

Once the application is installed, it's automatically started through
a dedicated user (with auto-login configured) using the
``~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart`` file::

  @python -m argos --fullscreen --no-tooltips

Debugging
=========

One can run a shell in sandbox and call the application through
``pdb``::

  $ flatpak run --command=sh --devel app.argos.Argos
  [ðŸ“¦ app.argos.Argos ~]$ python3 -m pdb /app/bin/argos --debug

Contributing
============

One can install dependencies and configure pre-commit hooks in a
dedicated virtual environment using ``poetry``::

  $ poetry shell
  $ poetry install
  $ pre-commit install

Pre-commit hooks run ``mypy`` check and make sure code is properly
formatted (using ``black``).

To update translation files::

  $ rm -rf builddir
  $ meson builddir && cd builddir
  builddir$ meson compile app.argos.Argos-update-po

The file `generated-poetry-sources.json
</generated-poetry-sources.json>`_ is generated from ``poetry``'s lock
file using `flatpak-builder-tools
<https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools>`_.
